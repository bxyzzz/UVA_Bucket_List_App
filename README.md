Honestly, I definitely learned a lot while building this app. While I took boilerplate from Philipp Lackner's Notes CRUD app, I purposely chose something that wasn't 1-to-1, especially since I had to figure out things like DatePickers by hand.

What was frustrating sometimes was the fact that it seems that Material 2 and Material 3 have some problems with portability, and that many resources online for Kotlin and Android Studio aren't necessarily up-to-date. For example, I was trying to implement a TopBar through Scaffolding but it's "experimental" and I didn't figure out how to get rid of the error until the last day of the assignment. Most notably, I realized that I often didn't know how to write a lot of the code because of the lack of hands-on practice I had before this app. Once I got the boilerplate and the classes set up though, everything became very smooth, especially the debugging. It became very easy to trace how things are passed from M to VM to V for example.
